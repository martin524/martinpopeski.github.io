## Introduction
In this project I will be exploring dataset that I found about the Titanic
accident. My goal is to find out whether there were evacuation preferences
according to age, sex, passenger class, and few other variables. Some of the
questions that I hope to answer are:

+ Were the children and the women evacuated first?
+ Were the passengers in 1st class evacuated sooner than the ones in 2nd and 3rd?
+ Did the passengers that had family onboard had lower chances of survival?

These are just small partition of the questions that I will be looking to answer
in this project, leading to the ultimate question of
+ **What kind of a profile would be most likely to survive the Titanic accident?**

I divided my project in 2 parts:
1. Cleaning the dataset and preparing it for data analysis
2. Analysis of the dataset and describing the perfect survivor

## 1. Cleaning the dataset and preparing it for data analysis
**[My code can be found on this link](https://github.com/martinpopeski/titanic_project_part1/blob/master/titanic_workspace_1.ipynb)**

In this part of the project my goal was the clean up the dataset and make it as
user friendly as possible. I needed to fill in missing values, deal with
unusually high and low values in the columns, and dropping out unnecessary rows
and columns. One of the biggest challenges was deciding how to fill in the
missing values of the Age column (one of the most important ones) with reasonable
assumptions and as little influence on the outcomes of this analysis as possible.
I managed to transform the dataset from:
